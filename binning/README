dir binning

Binning is a generic algorithm for determining which chains in the Ag
are in closest contact with the Ab. It uses an algorithm identical to
that in dir contacts to determine which residues in the antibody are within
a given distance, and counts the number of residues in the Ab in contact
with each Ag residue and accumulates them into a total number of contact
residues for each Ag chain.
