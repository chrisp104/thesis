dir contacts

Contacts is for determining the number of Ab contact residues for a given Ag.
One "contact" run is executed for each Ab:Ag docked model, which should be
in one pdb file.

The results will return the CB residues in the Ag that have contacts
within a given distance (in angstroms), the number of Ab residues, and 
the specific Ab residues that are in contact.

There is also an option to simply display the total number of contacts for
a given Ag, disregarding which Ag residues they correspond to.
