dir mutagenesis

The overall purpose here is to look at which Ab residues each Ag residue is
in contact with (within 8 angstroms) and create mutations on the Ag at those points
that are disruptive to the model(s) - takes output of res_contacts from *contacts*
directory

All one_* directories contain just the top scoring Ab design data and 
two_* directories contain top two = top scoring, and then the Ab design within
10 REUs with the highest RMSD to the top scoring.


All the run_* python scripts are numbered in order of use

mutate.py - create disruptive mutations from a _contacts.txt file for a docking model

rank_mutations.py - rank a given mutation across all docking models, eliminating
	mutations that are not disruptive to an affected model

create_triple.py - create triple mutation variants - mutations must be within 12 angstroms of each other

cluster_triple.py - cluster what we made from above


count_models.py - to count the number of mutations needed to cover all models
