BINNING 

	is a generic algorithm for determining which chains in the Ag
	are in closest contact with the Ab. It uses an algorithm identical to
	that in dir contacts to determine which residues in the antibody are within
	a given distance, and counts the number of residues in the Ab in contact
	with each Ag residue and accumulates them into a total number of contact
	residues for each Ag chain. 


INTERSECTION

	is an algorithm to take the NUMBER of Ab contact residues along the Ag residues
	and compute percent similarity in those (intersection / union) across
	different models
