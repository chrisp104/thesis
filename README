Winter - Spring 2017

The overarching aim of this project is two-fold:
1.  To attempt to reproduce cross-blocking (epitope binning) results in silico using antibody (Ab) design, 
		Ab:Antigen (Ag) docking servers, and mutational manipulation and redocking.
2. 	To integrate experimental cross-blocking data to improve and refine in silico Ab:Ag docking predictions.

DESCRIPTIONS OF DIRECTORIES

*** ./antibodies/ ***
	prepare_files.sh - bash script to prepare files for functions in other directories
		removes HEADER, ANISOU, END lines
	Contains the bulk of the data. 
	- One Antibody from the Ab table
		- Docking models
			- Ab:Ag contact information folders and docking model pdb files

*** ./binning/ ***
	ag_binner.py - counts number of Ab residue contacts for all Ag residues for a given chain across
		all docking models for a given Ab model and then returns totals, which can be useful in checking 
		binning
	bulk_bin.py - to run ag_binner across multiple models

*** ./contacts/ ***
	see README in directory

	*** ./histogram/ ***
		takes all_contact information and creates a histogram to see contact distribution for given docking model
			across all models

*** ./intersection/ ***
	intersection.py - will compare two contact data files (one for each docking model) returned by contact methods
		in contacts directory and find percentage of overlapping contacts.
		
	*** ./heatmaps/ ***
		take output from intersection.py and run through array_maker.py to turn in matrix for heatmap maker
		see example.py for how to make a heatmap

*** ./isdb/ ***
	Contains isdb protein structures, individual domains and whole structure

*** ./rmsd/ ***
	rmsd_pep - will compare rmsd between two docking models for the Ag, given the Ag chains - do not have to have the same
		chain letters but must have same amino acid numberings
	rmsd_chain - must have same chain letters
	run_* - will bulk run the rmsd
